# 🩺 Kidney Disease Prediction System

## Overview
This project developed a **Kidney Disease Prediction System (KDPS)** using supervised machine learning models to identify patients at risk of kidney disease based on clinical indicators.

## Objective
To enable early detection and intervention by classifying patients using medical data features such as blood pressure, serum creatinine, and albumin levels.

## Techniques
- **Algorithms:** Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Neural Network  
- **Tools:** Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib  
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

## Results
- The **Neural Network model** achieved the highest accuracy of 96%.  
- Early risk prediction helps improve patient outcomes and reduce treatment cost.
