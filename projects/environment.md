# 🌿 Environmental Pollution Prediction

## Overview
Created a machine learning model to predict **air pollution levels (PM2.5)** using environmental and meteorological datasets.

## Objective
To estimate pollution concentration for proactive environmental management and urban planning.

## Techniques
- **Modeling:** Random Forest, Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)  
- **Tools:** Python, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib  
- **Feature Engineering:** Humidity, Temperature, Wind Speed, AQI Components

## Results
- XGBoost outperformed Random Forest with an R² score of 0.91.  
- Visualization of pollution spikes matched meteorological events.

## Repository Assets
